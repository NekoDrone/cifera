# cifera

[cat thief.](https://honkai-star-rail.fandom.com/wiki/Cipher)

a tool that helps you make your own colourscheme based on [catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/palette) so long as you adhere to the schema provided by catppuccin.

## usage

tbd, but you should just need to provide a mapping file, then run the tool pointed at a catppuccin port project and it'll automatically steal it for you

it can't steal ci pipelines, so you gotta set that up yourself, but it'll be an easy way to almost instantly create ports of the stuff you want so long as catppuccin has already provided that tooling.

catppuccin is mit licensed so it should be fine, but obviously you should credit the original maintainer(s)/contributor(s) of the port.

## development

also tbd, but nix provides.

`nix develop` should get you working (eventually, when i figure all that out)

if not using nix, then you need to install the rust toolchain because this project will be written in rust.

## contributions

this project exists as a single readme rn what contributions do you want

when this reaches some form of a stable release, i'll happily take any and all contributions from issues to prs.
